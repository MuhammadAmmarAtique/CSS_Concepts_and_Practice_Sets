# CSS Practice & Problem Solving

This repository contains my CSS learning materials, practice code, and problem-solving examples.

## Directory Structure

1. **CSS**  
   - `index.html`, `style.css`: Practical solutions to various CSS problems, including topics like colors, selectors, text properties, box model, flexbox, media queries, and animations etc. Previous versions of the code can be explored through Git commit history.
  
2. **Class Notes**  
   - `cssnotes.pdf`: Notes covering CSS topics and properties.

3. **PracticeSets**  
   - Contains images of questions/problems (`practice set1.png` to `practice set8.png`). The solutions are implemented in the CSS folder files.

## How to Use

- Review the CSS folder for code solutions to the problems.  
- Use the Git commit history to explore earlier code versions and practice evolution.
